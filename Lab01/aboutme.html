            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a 20 year old college student. I don't currently work because I'd rather focus on my education.
                I have a loving family and friends that look out for me.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                
                I am a student at Community College of Baltimore County. I am currently majoring in General Studies.
                However, I plan to transfer to Towson University. There I will switch my major to Computer Science.

            <h2>Skills/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>

                One of my favorite hobbies is gaming. I love playing video games in my free time.
                While they can be stressful, they can also be very rewarding and fun. I also love to
                binge watch shows. I mostly binge watch game shows like Surivor and Big Brother. I plan
                to go on one of those shows.
